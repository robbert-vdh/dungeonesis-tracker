# Changelog

## [1.3.0] - 2019-11-16

### Added

- Added support for Iron Man characters. These characters won't be able to share
  their quest rewards with other characters. The extra bonus banner has to be
  added manually since this depends on the level of the quest.
- Added a way to add the 60 timeskip leveling stars (don't forget to remove any
  leftover stars through `Add Stars -> Edit Manuallyâ€¦`).

### Changed

- Update for patch 6.0.
- Added an ellipsis to the `Edit Manually` button to make it clearer that this
  opens a modal.
- Changed the wording on some of the rewards.
