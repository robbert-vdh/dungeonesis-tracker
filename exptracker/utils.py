"""
This module contains some constants and utilities for converting between
stars and levels.

The EXP system works as follows:

- To advance to the next level, you need to acquare 8 banners.
- Banners can be bought with stars. A banner costs a single star at level one,
  with the cost of a banner increasing by a single star for every three levels
  after the fifth level.

The rules are implemented here mostly for reference since the EXP system is
rather freeform and does not have a lot of rules. These conversion functions
are also separately implemented in the front end to allow for easy display of
and modifications to a character's progress.
