# Gate Marches character tracker

This is an experience and level tracker specific to the Dungeons & Dragons
campaign. Because why would you spent seconds fiddling with paper if you could
write a webapp instead?

## Building and running

All dependencies are managed using [Poetry](https://poetry.eustace.io/) and the
back end relies on a PostgreSQL server. By default the application uses the
included [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) configuration. To
the dependencies and run the application, simply run:

```shell
docker-compose up -d
yarn build  # Or `yarn dev` for a quicker build without optimizations
poetry run ./manage.py migrate
poetry run ./manage.py runserver
```
